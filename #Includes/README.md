# Major change upcoming (1/17/23)

As it stands right now, I'm absolutely no longer willing to maintain siege.ahk in AutoHotkey v2. It was fun while it lasted, but since I've gotten more involved with C# again lately, I've decided to move siege.ahk to its own repository. It will retain all the functionality, but in C# instead of AHKv2.
The initial commit for that will be pushed as soon as a semi-complete version of the C# version exists.
