/**
 * My codebase library for most of my other AHK scripts.
 *
 * Coding conventions:
 *
 * - The entire library is written to allow for easy modification and expansion, making the functions somewhat prone to changes. The idea is, however, to ensure that either all calls to functions only produce different results while leaving the function's syntax untouched (or only changed so that calls to it do not have to be changed to be valid, such as adding optional parameters), or that a syntax change is easy enough to fix using regex Find-and-Replace.
 * - Most comparisons are hard-coded case-sensitive (operator `==` instead of `=`). This does _not_ apply to functions the express use of which is string comparison, in which case an optional parameter allows for control over this. Most, if not all, default to `true`, i.e. a case-sensitive comparison. Additionally (as per AHKv2 behavior), case-sense is ignored for comparisons where one of the operands is not of type `String` (ex. objects).
 * - String concatenations are / should always be done explicitly: `"string 1" . " " . var` instead of `"string 1" " " var`.
 * - Most, if not all, cases where braces (`{ }`) _may_ be omitted, they _are_ present. I've recently (1/19/2022) noticed some extremely odd behavior relating to `if`s in any form of loop, be it introduced by `Loop` or `for`. The loop would sometimes be left prematurely, even though no `return` or `break` keywords were encountered. Adding braces prevented this from happening, which probably means the AHKv2 parser messes up somewhere and breaks out of the loop if an `if` clause executed incorrectly. It also did not _always_ do this, causing some confusion as to what this "incorrect execution" even is. I still haven't found an answer for that, but omitting braces seems to cause it, which is why I've decided to add them wherever appropriate (or possible, rather), even if this is only technically necessary when there's an `if` construct in the loop: `( {2,})((?:loop|for|if|else|try|catch|while).*\n)(.*)` and `$1$2$1{\n$3\n$1}`.
 * - On 2/9/2022 and 5/3/2022, there have been updates to the `thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp` VSCode extension which cause it to highlight several (working!) things as errors even if the definitions as such are valid and script runs and compiles fine. This includes, but is not limited to:
 * - - Hotkey definitions such as `NumpadDot::.` (which would remap the `NumpadDot` key, which produces a `,` instead of a `.` in some locales, to `.` in all cases), which are marked as a `Unknown token '.'` severity 8 (`error`) problem. This is likely due to a change in the way control / accessor tokens such as a single dot character is interpreted.
 * - - Hotstring definitions such as `:*?:>\:??::>:3` (which would correct the sequence `>:??` to `>:3` immediately upon typing it), ~~which are marked as a `Unexpected ':'` severity 8 (`error`) problem. This is likely due to a change in the way key combinations and, as such, hotstring definitions are interpreted.~~ Update: some specific hotstring definitions are now marked as _multiple_ errors. How _do_ you fuck up that badly?
 * - - Function calls such as `Click(300, 400)`, which are marked as a `Expected 0-1 parameters, but got 2` severity 8 (`error`) problem. The shown syntax is valid and works.
 * - The "Lower Camel Case" naming convention is followed (e.g. `mapOperations`, not `MapOperations`), except in class definitions when the intention of these is _not_ solely to hold `static` functions and constants, but to actually be instantiated into an object (e.g. `codebase.math.vectorGeometry.Vector`, not `codebase.math.vectorGeometry.vector`).
 *
 * The functions and some classes are annotated using comments, allowing IntelliSense to display parameter and other information. Basically, to get the most out of this, use the following commands (Windows):
 * - `code --install-extension zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug`
 * - `code --install-extension thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp`
 *
 * This "script" is a pure library. While it does technically contain an autorun section to set directives or similar, it will exit immediately upon finishing this.

             * @param l The lower index of the range to sort. Defaults to `1` if omitted.
             * @param r The upper index of the range to sort. Defaults to `arr.Length` if omitted.
             * @note When `stringComp` is truthy, `StrCompare` with the `"Logical"` setting is used as the sort callback function. The following problems arise when comparing strings containing both letters _and_ numbers, numerical strings and strings containing _only_ letters:
             * - `"39.21"` is considered greater than `"39.3"` (`"39.21" > "39.3"`, but `"39.2" < "39.3"`, _but_ `"39.21" < "39.30"`).
             * - The above applies to mixed strings like `"a39.21"`.
             * - Rules such as `"39.21" < "39.30"` only hold if the compared items are both strings and have the same decimal precision.
             * - Pure numbers and numerical strings are considered less than mixed and letter-only strings: `[1, "2.3", 7.33, "a", "b", "b6", "b7", "b7.3", "b7.21", "c"]`. This allows sorting floats as strings to prevent floating-point precision errors. To create a string from a float so that it works with this sort function, use `String(Round())` on all floats to be sorted and round them to the _same_ precision.
